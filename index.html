        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>
          From sketchbook to source code â€“ Iâ€™m a creative mind who took the
          scenic route. After studying fashion design and spending several years
          working in the fashion industry, I decided it was time for a complete
          reboot â€“ this time into the world of IT. Why? Because I love
          challenges, and solving problems with structure, logic, and a bit of
          curiosity excites me just as much as great design (and great food).<br />
          What sets me apart? I'm a self-starter through and through â€“ whether
          it was learning to sew during my studies or teaching myself to code
          today, I dive into new things with curiosity, perseverance, and more
          than a few YouTube tutorials. Iâ€™m also highly organized â€“ enough to
          keep even chaotic photo shoots or trade shows running smoothly (and
          still smile through them).<br />
          I truly believe that good work only happens in good teams â€“ with
          mutual respect, open communication, and a healthy dose of humor.
          Because team vibes arenâ€™t just nice to have â€“ theyâ€™re everything.<br />
          In my free time, youâ€™ll find me with a wooden spoon, dumbbells, or on
          the treadmill â€“ or out exploring new places, preferably the ones with
          good food.
